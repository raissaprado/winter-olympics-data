		<h2 >The growth of women by the Winter Olympics Organization</h2>

		<p>While we wait for Corona to let us have Beijing’s Winter Olympics, let us check how far women go in the history of this multi-sport event. On this website we will analyze data from 1924 to 2014 olympic winners in order to show you the girl power.</p>

		<!-- pizza graph showing total of men and women medals-->

		<p>Overall, the majority of men winners over women is undeniable. The total of medals given is decided beforehand by the olympics organization, so the data hereby analyzed reflects only on the point of view of the organization and not the achievement of each gender.</p>

			<h3 class=”subhead”>The ‘right sport’ to be a women</h3>

			<p>Once upon a time, in 1924, the far white land of Chamonix (France) would host the first Winter Olympics. Among 258 athletes, only 11 were women, and 6 went back home with a Skating medal. That was one small step for men, one giant leap for womankind.</p>

			<p>Three editions later, in 1936, women would conquer the first medal in other sport than skating: skiing awarded 3 women and 27 men that year. Due to World War II, the next Winter Olympics happened only in 1948 at St Moritz, Switzerland. This year had 77 women athletes, resulting from 15 medals and Canada’s first women bringing a medal home.</p>

			<p>It took time for women to have their moment to shine. Did they catch up and had more space in other sports?</p>

			<p>As we can see, Skating and Skiing are by far the main sport for women, but not for men.</p>

			<h3 class=”subhead”>Location, location, location</h3>

			<p>In 1988 happened the Calgary’s Winter Olympic, where the story from Cool Runnings occurred. If you haven't seen this film yet, don’t blame me for telling some spoilers: Jamaica’s bobsleigh team didn’t win that year, or any of the years that followed. Despite the engaging story, we can’t be surprised with that fact, after all, they don’t even have the appropriate weather to train for it. </p>

			<p>The event from 1992 was called by many as remarkable: Germany was back (after its unification), and South Africa was back after a thirty-two-year banishment. Let’s put aside all the political drama and focus on our girls: 72 medalists, Germany in the spotlight with 16 women in the podium, followed by the United States with 12. The proud women in me salute the proud women in you (although both of us have nothing to do with this achievement).</p>

			<p>In all these events, where are the winners? As you can see below, most of the countries with more men winning also have women in it.</p>

			<p>In the bottom of winners Luxembourg and Romania never had a women in a podium, however, they had only 2 medals each, so there is not much expectation on their results.</p>

			<h1 class="hidden">Women X TIME</h1>
			<h3 class=”subhead”>Time after time</h3>
			<p>You don’t need to know Cyndi Lauper to be aware that Girl’s just wanna have FUN-damental rights. Haha, got it? </p>

			<p>Can women have a bigger spotlight in sports events? YES, WE CAN! To show it, let's have a look on CANada growth of medalists through the years.</p>

			<!--line graph showing canadian women medals though the years-->
			<!--line graph showing canadian men medals though the years-->

			<p>It took time for Canada to become a great champion in the Winter Olympics (overall it is in second place, losing only to the United States). Between the late 60's and 80's it's a result quite painful to see, for instance, in 1972 there was only one medal, gained by a woman (boo hoo, women rock!).</p>

			<p>The 90's is not only the best decade for culture, but also for Canada Winter Olympics podiums, with a major rise for women and men winners. </p>

			<p>O Canada! Our home and native land!</p>
